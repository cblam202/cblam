  <!-- About -->
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am a data analyst in Teacher Education and Accreditation at the College of Education, Kansas State University. I also serve as a Program Reviewer for the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (<a href="https://caepnet.org/" target="_blank">CAEP</a>) and the Kansas State Department of Education (<a href="https://www.ksde.gov/" target="_blank">KSDE</a>). My research focuses on policy and practice in teacher education, teacher workforce and labor markets, and teacher labor activism.</p>

  <p>I am originally from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rfg53xKahDrPWZmKA" target="_blank">Phu Yen, Vietnam</a>. I earned a bachelor's degree in Mathematics Education at the <a href="https://hcmue.edu.vn/en/" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh City University of Education</a>, and a master's, and a Ph.D. degree in Curriculum and Instruction at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/" target="_blank">Kansas State University</a>, working with Dr. Tuan D. Nguyen (University of Missouri) and Dr. Sherri Martinie (Kansas State University).</p>

  <p>Dr. Nguyen and I currently maintain a publicly available dataset on teacher shortages, aiming to inform policymakers and the public on the extent of teacher staffing challenges in the United States: <a href="https://teachershortages.com/" target="_blank">teachershortages.com</a>.</p>
